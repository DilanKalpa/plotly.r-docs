### New to Plotly?

Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
[Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

### Version Check

Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>
Check out [this post](http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/) for more information on breaking changes and new features available in this version.

```r
library(plotly)
packageVersion('plotly')
```

```
## [1] '4.9.1'
```

### Dates


```r
library(plotly)
today <- Sys.Date()
tm <- seq(0, 600, by = 10)
x <- today - tm
y <- rnorm(length(x))
p <- plot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, mode = 'lines', text = paste(tm, "days from today"))

p
```
